# 🤖 Search and Rescue Robot (SLAM + A* Pathfinding)

This repository showcases a university project using the Anki Cozmo robot in a simulated search and rescue environment. The robot navigates unknown spaces, maps the environment, and plans optimal rescue paths using SLAM and A* algorithms.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `slam/`: SLAM algorithm implementation.
- `navigation/`: Pathfinding using the A* algorithm.
- `localisation/`: Robot position estimation.
- `robot_sensors/`: Sensor readings and processing.
- `main_code/`: Combined code used in the final demo.
- `data/`: Cube and wall data from real runs.
- `docs/`: Full project report and research findings.
- `attempts/`: Earlier development versions and tests.

## 🧠 Technologies

- Python
- Cozmo SDK
- SLAM with particle filters
- A* pathfinding
- Sensor fusion
- Manual calibration and localisation

## 🧾 Reports

- **Search And Rescue Report** – complete project methodology, results, and analysis.
- **Robot Sensors Report** – exploration of sensor limitations and calibration techniques.

## 🧪 Notes

This code was developed for academic purposes. Some paths and integrations are specific to the Cozmo robot simulation. Hardware or real-robot testing is not included in this repository.
